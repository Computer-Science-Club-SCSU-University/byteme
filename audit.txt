*****************************************************************
The computer science program offer students an introduction to
the theoretical and practical foundations of computer science
with emphases in data structures, computer architecture,
operating systems, file processing, programming languages, and
ethics in computing. Students may earn credits for supervised
internship work in cooperation with regional industries when
they have completed certain required computer science; however,
internship credits do not apply toward satisfying requirements
for the majors.

*****************************************************************
The computer science program offer students an introduction to
the theoretical and practical foundations of computer science
with emphases in data structures, computer architecture,
operating systems, file processing, programming languages, and
ethics in computing. Students may earn credits for supervised
internship work in cooperation with regional industries when
they have completed certain required computer science; however,
internship credits do not apply toward satisfying requirements
for the majors.

*****************************************************************
The computer science program offer students an introduction to
the theoretical and practical foundations of computer science
with emphases in data structures, computer architecture,
operating systems, file processing, programming languages, and
ethics in computing. Students may earn credits for supervised
internship work in cooperation with regional industries when
they have completed certain required computer science; however,
internship credits do not apply toward satisfying requirements
for the majors.

*****************************************************************
The computer science program offer students an introduction to
the theoretical and practical foundations of computer science
with emphases in data structures, computer architecture,
operating systems, file processing, programming languages, and
ethics in computing. Students may earn credits for supervised
internship work in cooperation with regional industries when
they have completed certain required computer science; however,
internship credits do not apply toward satisfying requirements
for the majors.
